# Capstone

Starting my capstone project (date: 18 march)
Full-stack web development
Capstone Project
Project name: Upright Institution ⟰

Idea brief:

My project is a bit based on my goal to provide good and quality education to those who can’t afford it. With that, I want it to be made for commercial purposes also.

So my website will have a main (home) page for users where they first sign up and move on to the website, and according to their preference they can select their course and if that course has a scholarship scheme, they can apply it. A test will be conducted to determine the percentage of scholarships they are getting. The website will also have a connecting feature with whatapp. Students can pay the fees in online mode. The main owner would have a different main page and different things, where he will get the information regarding admission, scholarship applied, forms submitted, etc.

Plan of action:

On the first day, I will create a readme file and set up my project.
On the Second day, I will think of my UI and website blueprint.
On the Third day, will make a low fid prototype.

UI Design looks like:
Search bar, Navigational bar, Home Page, At last some details where I mention social media handles and contact us information. And a feature to direct connect with watsapp and some necessary forms as per required.
😅 Website blueprint is created in rough(on paper)🫢.[so sorry can't mention/draw here 🫣]
